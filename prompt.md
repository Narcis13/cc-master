introspect yourself as a coding agent (best in the world) , read and analyze                 
 spec docs in ./flowscript and  @docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md and lnowing your internals and capabilities propose an 
   coding workflow / strategy to implement this project(extend it). It could be PRD + implementing each       
  item in a session, something like a Ralph loop, something more methodical like looppool-cc        
  plugin, even this cc-orchestrator skill or anything in between. YOU are the coding , planner      
  and project manager mastermind, so , go ahead and come up with an optimal strategy .
