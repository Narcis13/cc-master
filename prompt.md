introspect yourself as a coding agent (best in the world)  and knowing your internals and capabilities propose an 
   coding workflow / strategy to implement this project(extend it). It could be PRD + implementing each       
  item in a session, something like a Ralph loop, something more methodical like /gsd plugin , batches sprint, vertical slics sprint      
  ,  anything in between. YOU are the coding , planner      
  and project manager mastermind, so , go ahead and come up with an optimal strategy .


  to do :

  - hooks
  - parse context usage
  - prompt too big when starting cc-agents + more autonomous 20 sec for questions and after that make decision itself
  - send /clear or /usage to agents
  - develop an UI to see whats inside sqlite database
  - run orchestrator from dashboard to manage it
  - design and implement : atomic sprints skills/commands
